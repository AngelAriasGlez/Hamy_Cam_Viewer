Hamy Cam Viewer
===============

A VLC SDL based viewer for the Hamy C-200 camera and STK1160 (EasyCap/EyeSight) 4 channel receiver. 
Allows users to switch camera view from channels 1-4 by hitting the appropriate key. Sadly no simultaneous viewing due to hardware limitations (STK1160 only outputs one stream at a time from device).

Requires SDL2 and libvlc to run
